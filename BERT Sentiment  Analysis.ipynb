The scallops were tender with a great acidity and use of mango and peppers. The steak was tender and I got the hint of tequila in the sauce. I enjoyed a watermelon salad that complimented the the steak. The portions are good, but a stretch if you are sharing. My only down point is the service. They really only showed up to present my next plate and never checked to see if I wanted another drink (which I did).<br/><br/>Enjoyed the food.</span></p>]"

A lovely big restaurant with a bar at the front (which is a bit awkward to try and push past everyone to get to your table). Friendly, helpful staff which is always a good start. The menu is large so we went with the \"feed me\" selection. All you need to do is sit back and let the chef feed you. As the other reviewers have stated the corn is a highlight and the pulled pork tacos, the sangria wasn\\'t bad either.Loved the Mexican tapas style food and will be back.',\n",
       " 'The food is fresh and tasty.  The scallop ceviche started the lunch. The scallops were tender with a great acidity and use of mango and peppers. The steak was tender and I got the hint of tequila in the sauce. I enjoyed a watermelon salad that complimented the the steak. The portions are good, but a stretch if you are sharing. My only down point is the service. They really only showed up to present my next plate and never checked to see if I wanted another drink (which I did).Enjoyed the food.']"

A few minutes later when 4 more joined our party and we explained to the server we had 6, he just quickly switched our table. <br/>I really enjoyed my serenity tea, just what I needed after a long flight in from Sfo that morning.

I will start adding this to mine now at home, and have fond memories for my trip to Sydney. <br/>2 friends ordered the salmon Benedict- saying it was delicious, and their go to every time they come here. <br/>2 friends had a breakfast sandwich- I'm not sure of the name.

We tried ordering multiple times and each time were let down with them not having what we wanted. It's understandable to not have certain things, but to have half of your menu not available is a bit ridiculous. When we finally were able to get something it was good, but we had to wait around 10-15 minutes after ordering to be told that they were out of something. Disappointing because of high expectations.</span></p>,\n",

Worth the walk over the Pyrmont bridge.</span></p>,\n",

I ate them pretty fast and didn't share with anyone because they were that good ;). <br/><br/>I ordered a green smoothie to balance it all out. Smoothie was a nice way to end my brekkie at this restaurant. <br/><br/>Others with me ordered the salmon Benedict and the smoked salmon flatbread. They were all delicious and all plates were empty. <br/><br/>Cheers!</span></p>,\n",

Everything on the menu not only sounds delicious, but is really tasty. It really gave us a sour taste of how bad breaky is in America with what's so readily available in Sydney!  Both days we went were Saturdays and there was a bit of a wait to be seated, the cafe is extremely busy for both dine-in and take-away. Service is fairly quick and servers are all friendly. The location is in Surrey Hills a couple blocks away from the bustling touristy Darling Harbor.<br/>The green smoothie is very tasty and refreshing. We tried the smoked salmon salad, the soft shell crab tacos, ricotta hotcakes, and the breaky sandwich. All were delicious, well seasoned, and a solid amount of food for the price. A definite recommend for anyone's trip into Sydney!</span></p>,\n",

All said they were hot and delicious. 2 of us ordered the avo on toast. So yummy with the beetroot... I will start adding this to mine now at home, and have fond memories for my trip to Sydney. 2 friends ordered the salmon Benedict- saying it was delicious, and their go to every time they come here. 2 friends had a breakfast sandwich- I'm not sure of the name. It did look delicious. Adorable cafe, friendly staff, clean restroomsVery popular with the locals. I plan to come back the next time I'm in Sydney\",\n",
       " \"We came for brunch and they ran out of seven separate menu items. We tried ordering multiple times and each time were let down with them not having what we wanted. It's understandable to not have certain things, but to have half of your menu not available is a bit ridiculous. When we finally were able to get something it was good, but we had to wait around 10-15 minutes after ordering to be told that they were out of something. Disappointing because of high expectations.\",\n",
       " 'Great place with delicious food and friendly staff. It is small but has outdoor seating and a relaxed ambiance. Perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee. I am visiting Sydney for the first time but this place seems like is a local favorite.',\n",
       " 'The food was delicious. The ricotta pancakes were light and tasty.  The cream brûlée French toast was a fruit lovers delight. There was fresh strawberries, blueberries, passion fruit and custard. No syrup required. And crispy kale as a side ordered with eggs. Worth the walk over the Pyrmont bridge.',\n",
       " 'Great food amazing coffee and tea. Short walk from the harbor. Staff was very friendly',\n",
       " \"Great service, lovely location, and really amazing food. Words don't do justice. We had the mushroom parm bruschetta and the loaded double double. Both were so tasty. Also love the Aussie black tea and a flat white. Wish I had more mornings in Sydney to eat breakfast there. Highly recommend.\",\n",
       " \"Ricotta hot cakes! These were so yummy. I ate them pretty fast and didn't share with anyone because they were that good ;). I ordered a green smoothie to balance it all out. Smoothie was a nice way to end my brekkie at this restaurant. Others with me ordered the salmon Benedict and the smoked salmon flatbread. They were all delicious and all plates were empty. Cheers!\",\n",
       " \"We came for brunch twice in our week-long visit to Sydney. Everything on the menu not only sounds delicious, but is really tasty. It really gave us a sour taste of how bad breaky is in America with what's so readily available in Sydney!  Both days we went were Saturdays and there was a bit of a wait to be seated, the cafe is extremely busy for both dine-in and take-away. Service is fairly quick and servers are all friendly. The location is in Surrey Hills a couple blocks away from the bustling touristy Darling Harbor.The green smoothie is very tasty and refreshing. We tried the smoked salmon salad, the soft shell crab tacos, ricotta hotcakes, and the breaky sandwich. All were delicious, well seasoned, and a solid amount of food for the price. A definite recommend for anyone's trip into Sydney!\",\n",
       " \"It was ok. Had coffee with my friends. I'm new in the area, still need to discover new places.\"]"
